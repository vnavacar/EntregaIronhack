# Final Project

**This is the end of the Bootcamp, a good moment to check if you master the concepts** and you can continue their learning path towards more advanced topics in future. 

**You will work in groups of at least two members and they can choose their challenge** from both algorithms we learned in the past units:

- Use linear regression to predict the selling prices of houses based on a variety of features on which the value of the house is evaluated.
- Use logistic regression to understand the demographics and other characteristics of a bank customers' that accept a credit card offer and that do not accept a credit card.

### Goals

1. Present a professional project
    - Produce documentation to make the project accessible
    - Record a short video ( 6 mins. for project description and methodology + 1 min. for code demo ) accommodating your script to constraints (time, audience, etc.)
    - Build engaging presentations
2. Go through the whole Data Analysis process on their own, without much support. 
3. Use Python to interpret the structure
    - Pull the data as a dataframe in python.
    - Perform data cleaning and data wrangling in Python
7. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis 
    - Fit the model
    - Check accuracy of the model (exploring *Variance vs. Bias* tradeoff)
    - Iterate on the model to get more optimized results.
8. Perform the model deployment with `streamlit`

### Project | Deliverables

- You will be required to record a short video ( 6 mins. for project description and findings + 1 min. for demo of the streamlit app, **don't show the code** record yourselves using the app)
- The repo should be properly organized with specific use of folders and it should follow the naming conventions for folders ( data/, scalers/, models/ ).
